## Listener
- An object which responds to rule entry and exit events triggered by a parse-tree walker as it discovers and finishes nodes
- Listener methods are not responsible for explicit calling methods to walk their children

## Visitor
- Must explicitly trigger visits to child nodes to keep the tree traversal going
